To start, Enter an expression. The expression is of the form ([Number][Operand] ...Repeat). Pressing enter evaluates the expression in the order (/ * - +) by taking the 2 numbers on either side of the operator. Pressing = clears the current expression and shows the expression and answer in the section under the calculator. Pressing "c" at any time clears the current expression, and ac clears the current expression as well as the history section. c and ac clear the current expression, but does not update the window. after pressing enter to evaluate an expression, you can store the answer in memory with mr, and clear it with mc. if a number is in memory, the history section will be coloured red. Pressing m+ or m- will evaluate the current expression (equivalent of pressing =) and add/subtract the memory from the current expression.
